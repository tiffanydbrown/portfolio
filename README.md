# final-project

A full stack JavaScript solo project.

## Getting Started

Create a React app named `client`.
    ```sh
    npx create-react-app client
    ```

Use `npm install` from the `server` directory.

Create the database (you will need to provide the schema and data) using `npm run db:import`.
